## Simulate a Real Domain Locally using /etc/hosts

We will now simulate a real domain (I did not purchase a DNS as this is a learning project) by accessing our local microservices via postman at:

```http://accounts.fake.com/actuator/health```

1. Firstly run this command:

```kubectl get ingress accounts -n default```

Take note of the ADDRESS value â€” that's your ALB's DNS. Repeat for loans and cards.

2. Edit ```/etc/hosts``` on your machine

```sudo nano /etc/hosts```

3. Test in Postman.
